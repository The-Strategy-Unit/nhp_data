"""Same Day Emergency Care Conversion

The [Ambulatory Emergency Care Network](https://www.nhselect.nhs.uk/improvement-collaboratives/Clinical-networks/AEC) has published a Directory of Ambulatory Emergency Care for adults, 6th ed (2018) which identifies emergency conditions that have the potential to be managed as an emergency day case delivered in an SDEC unit.
We have grouped these conditions into four mitigator cohorts, those that the network suggest have a:

* low potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis (10-30% of cases) 
* moderate potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis (30-60% of cases)
* high potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis (60-90% of cases)
* very high potential to be managed on an ambulatory basis (90-100% of cases)

The spells identified by these mitigators exclude any with a length of stay (LOS) of 3 days and over, as these spells are considered less likely to be treatable within a day.
This mitigator allows Trusts to make an assumption about what proportion of the identified spells they think will, in future, be delivered within an SDEC facility and not as an admitted patient.
The model removes this quantity of spells from the inpatients data and adds them to the A&E outputs as type 5 (SDEC) attendances, enabling clear identification and quantification of future SDEC activity with the model outputs.

Note: these mitigators replace the previous set of Ambulatory Emergency Care (AEC) efficiency mitigators that adjusted the LOS of selected spells to 0 LOS but kept them within the inpatients (IP) dataset.
The change reflects the new requirement for Trusts to record SDEC activity within the ECDS dataset.

## Available Breakdowns

The model groups these individual conditions into four categories:

- Same day emergency care (low potential) (IP-EF-029)
- Same day emergency care (moderate potential) (IP-EF-030)
- Same day emergency care (high potential) (IP-EF-028)
- Same day emergency care (very high potential) (IP-EF-031)
