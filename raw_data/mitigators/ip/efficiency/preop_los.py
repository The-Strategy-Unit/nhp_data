"""Pre-Op Length of Stay

In most cases patients do not need to be admitted before the day of surgery. This model identifies
elective admissions that are admitted either 1 day prior to surgery, or 2 days prior to surgery.
Patients who are admitted more than 2 days prior to surgery are not included as it is assumed that
in these cases there is a valid clinical reason for the extended pre-op LOS.

# Available breakdowns

- Pre-op Length of Stay of 1 day (IP-EF-022)
- Pre-op Length of Stay of 2 days (IP-EF-023)
